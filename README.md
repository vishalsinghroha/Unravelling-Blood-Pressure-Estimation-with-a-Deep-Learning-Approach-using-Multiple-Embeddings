# Blood Pressure Estimation with Deep Learning and Multiple Embeddings

This repository provides an implementation of deep learning frameworks for **cuffless blood pressure (BP) estimation** using **pulse arrival time (PAT)** features and **multiple embedding strategies**. The implementation includes Euclidean and Manhattan distance-based representations and attention-driven convolutional models.

---

## Overview

The project introduces multiple neural network architectures designed to estimate systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure from PAT sequences.  
This implementation focuses on the **PTT-PPG** dataset, which provides synchronized ECG and PPG recordings with reference blood pressure values.

The core architectures include:

1. **AttentiveConvRegNet** â€” CNN with Channel and Spatial Attention 
2. **ConvolutionalPoolingRegNet** â€” Standard CNN with pooling layers
3. **NeuralRegressionNet** â€” Fully connected regression baseline

## Dataset

### 1. PTT-PPG Dataset
The **PTT-PPG dataset** from [PhysioNet](https://www.physionet.org/content/pulse-transit-time-ppg/1.0.0/) was used for this implementation.  
It contains synchronized **ECG** and **PPG** recordings with corresponding **blood pressure (BP)** measurements for multiple subjects.

### 2. MIMIC-II Cuff-less Blood Pressure Dataset
The main goal of this dataset is to provide clean and valid signals for designing cuff-less blood pressure estimation algorithms and to validate on a bigger dataset.  
The raw **ECG**, **PPG**, and **ABP** signals were originally collected from **PhysioNet**, and subsequently **preprocessed and validated** for research use.

> The provided implementation framework can be directly applied to both PTT-PPG and MIMIC-II datasets for model development and performance benchmarking.
